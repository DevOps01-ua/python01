**Task**: _Code Styles, Linting, Documentation, Unit Testing, and Virtual Environments_

**Objectives**:

**_Code Refactoring_**
1. Select a Python script from your previous HWs - prefferable HW3, but you can take HW1 with calculcator.
2. Refactor the code according to the PEP 8 style guide.
3. Make sure to use consistent naming conventions, indentation, and whitespace.


**_Linting and Code Quality_**
1. Install a Python code linter such as Flake8 or pylint on your local machine.
2. Run the linter on your refactored code and fix any reported style violations or code quality issues.

**_Documentation_**
1. Write comprehensive docstrings for each function and class in your refactored code.
2. Include descriptions, parameter explanations, return value details, and any relevant examples.
3. Ensure your docstrings follow the recommended format (e.g., Google-style or reStructuredText).

**_Unit Testing_**

1. Write unit tests using the unittest module.
2. Cover different use cases and edge cases in your tests to ensure comprehensive coverage.
3. Verify that the expected results match the actual results for each test case.

**_Virtual Environment and Dependency Management_**

1. Create a new virtual environment using a tool like venv or virtualenv.
2. Activate the virtual environment on your local machine.
3. Install any necessary dependencies or packages required for your refactored code using pip.
4. Create a requirements.txt file that lists all the installed packages in your virtual environment.

**_Submission Guidelines:_**

Submit your refactored code file with the appropriate code styling, linting, and documentation improvements.
Include a separate file or section that contains your unit tests.
Submit your requirements.txt file along with your code.
Make sure to provide clear instructions on how to set up and run your code, including activating the virtual environment and installing dependencies.
